# How to Use Gheychee Bot

## For Users

1.  **Start the Bot**:
    Find the bot in Telegram and tap **Start**.

2.  **Send a Link**:
    Copy a link from Instagram (Reels/Post) or X (Twitter).
    - Example X: `https://x.com/user/status/123456...`
    - Example Insta: `https://instagram.com/reel/abcde...`

3.  **Wait for Processing**:
    The bot will display "Typing..." (or Uploading Video).
    - **Note**: Video processing takes 3-10 seconds depending on the file size.

4.  **Download**:
    The video will appear directly in the chat. You can save it to your gallery.

## Troubleshooting

-   **"No media found"**: The account might be private. The bot can only download public videos.
-   **"Error processing"**: The link might be invalid or deleted.
-   **Slow Response**: Large videos takes time to download to the server and re-upload to Telegram.
